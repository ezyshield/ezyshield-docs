description: "An immutable record representing a point-in-time verification of business identity and payment details."

There are three core components to a verification:
* The **business** details
* The **contact person** authorised to act on behalf of the business
* The **bank account** details

To begin a verification, [create a verification](/api-reference/verifications/create-a-verification) using the Verification API.

ezyshield's Verification Engine then performs a comprehensive series of checks in real-time to verify the integrity of the details provided.

## Statuses

A verification can be in one of the following statuses:

| Status      | Description                                                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  🟡 `pending`  | The verification is in progress. **All verifications begin in this status.**     |
|  🟢 `verified`  | ezyshield was able to verify the integrity of the details provided.          |
|  🔴 `failed`   | ezyshield was unable to verify the integrity of the details provided.        |
|  🔴 `rejected`  | The verification has been rejected by the contact person.                    |
|  🔴 `error`     | The verification has encountered an unexpected error.                        |
|  ⚪ `cancelled` | The verification has been cancelled by a newer verification.                 |
|  ⚪ `expired`    | The verification has expired.                                                |


## Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a verification">
    Call the [create verification](/api-reference/verifications/create-a-verification) endpoint with the business details, contact person information, and bank account details.
    
    The verification begins in `pending` status while ezyshield performs automated checks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automated verification checks">
    ezyshield's Verification Engine performs a comprehensive series of checks in real-time to verify the integrity of the details provided.
    
    This includes validating business registration, bank account ownership, and contact person details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Contact person verification">
    Once automated checks complete, the contact person receives an SMS to their mobile number with instructions to complete identity verification.
    
    <Info>
    The SMS is sent automatically by ezyshield. No action is required from your application.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Biometric authentication">
    The contact person completes biometric authentication to confirm their identity:
  </Step>

  <Step title="Listen for webhook">
    ezyshield sends a [webhook](/next-steps/webhooks) when the verification completes.
    
    If the verification is successful, the verification will transition to the `verified` status. Otherwise, it will transition one of the remaining statuses.

    See [Statuses](#statuses) for details on each status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Attribution

Use attribution to link multiple verifications to the same record in your system (e.g., a payer or payee). This allows you to track verification history when details are updated.

Provide an `attribution_id` when creating a verification to group related verifications together.

<Tip>
Retrieve all verifications for a specific record using the `attribution_id` parameter in the [list verifications](/api-reference/verifications/list-verifications) endpoint.
</Tip>

**Example use case:** When a customer updates their bank account details, create a new verification with the same `attribution_id`. This creates a complete audit trail of all verification attempts for that customer.

## Biometric authentication

During the verification process, ezyshield will send a SMS message to the contact person's mobile number to verify their identity.

To verify the identity of the contact person, they must provide a government-issued ID image and then complete a face scan.

For customers that have an existing KYC process, ezyshield allows an existing government-issued ID image to be provided with the `contact_identity_portrait` parameter. This prevents the need for the customer to upload a government-issued ID image, resulting in a faster verification process.

Verifications linked by the same `attribution_id` will reuse the same government-issued ID image, when provided.

## Fingerprint

When a verification is initiated, ezyshield stores the business identity and payment details and provides a verification ID. This ID is designed to be stored in your system against a record.

The verification ID can later be supplied to [check a verification](/api-reference/checks/check-a-verification), which compares the current, supplied details against those store by ezyshield.

**Example use case:** Before processing a payment, check if saved details have been compromised in your system by comparing against the verification fingerprint.
