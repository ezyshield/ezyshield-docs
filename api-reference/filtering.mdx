## Filtering

Serveral endpoints support filtering to retrieve only the data you need. For example, you can filter verifications by status:

```http
GET /verification/v1/verifications?filter[status]=verified
```

<Note>
Individual endpoints support filtering different fields. Check the documentation for the specific endpoint you are working with.
</Note>

## Sorting

You can sort endpoint results by passing the `sort` parameter. Provide a comma-separated list of fields to sort by.

```http
GET /management/v1/entities?sort=name
```

To reverse the sort order, prefix the field with a hyphen (`-`):

```http
GET /management/v1/entities?sort=-name
```

<Note>
Individual endpoints support sorting different fields. Check the documentation for the specific endpoint you are working with.
