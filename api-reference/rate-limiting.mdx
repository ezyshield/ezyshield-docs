<Note>Rate limiting is currently in development and will be available soon.</Note>

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and protect against abuse.

For specific rate limits, see the [Management API](/api-reference/management/overview#rate-limits) and [Verification API](/api-reference/verification/overview#rate-limits) overview pages.

API responses include the `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers to provide information about the rate limit.

## Response headers

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Limit" type="integer">
The maximum number of requests allowed per minute.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Remaining" type="integer">
The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-RateLimit-Reset" type="integer">
Unix timestamp indicating when the rate limit window resets.
</ParamField>
