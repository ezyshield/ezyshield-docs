## Authentication
The ezyshield Management API uses token-based authentication. You may create API keys for your organization via the UI, and all requests are automatically scoped to the organization through the `Authorization` header.

Include your organization API key token in every request:
```http
Authorization: Bearer org_sk_da743ce6afad4996a621b8a151045aa7
```

<Note>Organization tokens always start with `org_sk_`.</Note>

To create an API key, go to the [Dashboard](https://app.ezyshield.com.au), navigate to your organization settings and create an API key.

## OpenAPI specification

The Management API is documented in the OpenAPI 3.1.0 format and can be viewed [here](/api-reference/management.json).
