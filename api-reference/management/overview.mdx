## Base URL
The base URL for the Management API is
```
https://api.ezyshield.com.au/management/v1
```

## Authentication

The Management API uses organization API keys for authentication. See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for details.

Organization API keys are scoped to your organization, and all requests are automatically scoped to the organization through the `Authorization` header.

<Note>Organization tokens always start with `org_sk_`.</Note>

To create an organization API key:
- Via the [Dashboard](https://app.ezyshield.com.au): Navigate to your organization settings and create an API key
- Via the API: Once you have created your first API key, you may [create additional keys via the API](/api-reference/organization-api-keys/create-an-organization-api-key). These keys will be associated with owner of the key used to create them and can be created with the same or reduced permissions.

## Rate limits

The Management API has a rate limit of **60 requests per minute per organization**. See the [Rate Limiting](/api-reference/rate-limiting) documentation for more information.

## OpenAPI specification

The Management API is documented in the OpenAPI 3.1.0 format and can be viewed [here](/api-reference/management.json).
