The ezyshield API uses token-based authentication. All requests must include an API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer token format.

## Authorization header

Include your API key token in every request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>
```

## API key types

The API uses two types of API keys, each scoped to different resources:

### Admin keys

Admin keys are used to authenticate requests to the [Management API](/api-reference/management/overview). These keys are scoped to your organization and allow you to manage your organization, workspaces, and API keys.

To create an admin key:
- Via the [Dashboard](https://app.ezyshield.com.au): Navigate to your organization settings and create an admin key
- Via the API: Once you have created your first admin key, you may [create additional keys via the API](/api-reference/admin-keys/create-an-admin-key)

### API keys

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the [Verification API](/api-reference/verification/overview). These keys are scoped to a specific workspace and allow you to verify business and banking details for that workspace.

To create an API key, use the [Management API](/api-reference/management/overview) to first [create a workspace](/api-reference/workspaces/create-a-workspace) and then [create an API key](/api-reference/api-keys/create-an-api-key).
