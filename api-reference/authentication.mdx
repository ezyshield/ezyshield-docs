The ezyshield API uses token-based authentication. All requests must include an API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer token format.

## Authorization header

Include your API key token in every request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>
```

## API key types

The API uses two types of API keys, each scoped to different resources:

### Organization API keys

Organization API keys are used to authenticate requests to the [Management API](/api-reference/management/overview). These keys are scoped to your organization and allow you to manage your organization, entities, and API keys.

To create an organization API key:
- Via the [Dashboard](https://app.ezyshield.com.au): Navigate to your organization settings and create an API key
- Via the API: Once you have created your first API key, you may [create additional keys via the API](/api-reference/organization-api-keys/create-an-organization-api-key)

### Entity API keys

Entity API keys are used to authenticate requests to the [Verification API](/api-reference/verification/overview). These keys are scoped to a specific entity and allow you to verify business and banking details for that entity.

To create an entity API key, use the [Management API](/api-reference/management/overview) to first [create an entity](/api-reference/entities/create-an-entity) and then [create an entity API key](/api-reference/entity-api-keys/create-an-entity-api-key).
