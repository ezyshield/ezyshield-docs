## Authentication

The Verification API uses entity API keys for authentication. See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for details.

Entity API keys are scoped to a specific entity, and all requests are automatically scoped to that entity through the `Authorization` header.

<Note>Entity tokens always start with `ent_sk_`.</Note>

To create an entity API key, use the [Management API](/api-reference/management/overview) to first [create an entity](/api-reference/entities/create-an-entity) and then [create an entity API key](/api-reference/entity-api-keys/create-an-entity-api-key).

## Rate limits

The Verification API has a rate limit of **60 requests per minute per entity**. See the [Rate Limiting](/api-reference/rate-limiting) documentation for more information.

## OpenAPI specification

The Verification API is documented in the OpenAPI 3.1.0 format and can be viewed [here](/api-reference/verification.json).
