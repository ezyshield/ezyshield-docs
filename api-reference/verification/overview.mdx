## Authentication

The Verification API uses API keys for authentication. See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for details.

To create an API key, use the [Management API](/api-reference/management/overview) to first [create a workspace](/api-reference/workspaces/create-a-workspace) and then [create an API key](/api-reference/api-keys/create-an-api-key).

## Rate limits

The Verification API has a rate limit of **60 requests per minute per workspace**. See the [Rate Limiting](/api-reference/rate-limiting) documentation for more information.
